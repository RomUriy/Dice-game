## Pig dice game rules:
Each turn the player rolls two dice. If the player gets 1 on any of the dice he earns nothing and another player gets his turn. On getting 2-6 on the dice, playerâ€™s sum is being added to his round score, until he decides to stash his current score. If the player stashed his score, the other player gets his turn.

If a player gets 6 on any dice twice in a row, the player loses all the points from his current and overall scores.

The player who got 100 (or more) points wins the game.

You can stash after a few throws. Or when accumulated particular number of points.

## Control your greed:
Develop you feeling of chanse. Play fast and risky or slowly but smart.
